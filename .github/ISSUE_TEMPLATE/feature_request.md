### Feature Request âœ¨

**Description:**

As a user, I would like to have a search functionality added to the website.

**Reason for the Feature:**

The addition of a search functionality would enhance the user experience by allowing users to quickly find specific content or information on the website.

**Expected Behavior:**

Upon entering a search query in the search bar and submitting it, the website should display relevant search results related to the query.

**Additional Details:**

It would be beneficial to have the search functionality prominently placed in the header section of the website for easy access. Additionally, autocomplete suggestions as the user types would further improve the usability of the search feature.

**Implementation Considerations:**

The search functionality could be implemented using JavaScript to perform asynchronous requests to a server-side search endpoint. The search results could then be dynamically rendered on the page without requiring a full page reload.
